Assignment 2 EXSM 3936

Summer Shields - stshield@ualberta.ca

Scope: Program that calculates perimeter and area based off of values entered by the user for one of three shape selections (rectangle, triangle, or circle). Each shape selection has its own system of evaluating the perimeter and area based off of the method of measurement for that shape. Each shape relies on a parent class to create a framework for each child shape class to follow.

Project Background:
Project created for submission of Assignment 2 in the EXSM 3926 course at the University of Alberta. Project materials and requirements based off of the learning from Module 2 and previous modules.
